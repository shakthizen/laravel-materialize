# Materilize CSS for Laravel

Laravel comes with Bootstrap by default. But there are many cool css frameworks out there. I think that [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com) is the most amazing but easy to use Material Design CSS framework so far. It has easy to use class names, grid system, waves effect, cool drop downs and collapsibles with easy to understand documentation. I wanted to include Materialize in Laravel so laravel looks cooler.

This will help you to start your Materialize Laravel project easyly.
